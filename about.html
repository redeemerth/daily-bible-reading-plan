              <p>
                This site was developed to make reading through the Bible, and accessing relevent, related content, as simple as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every day, a new reading is made available. The reading includes the complete text from the Bible, along with the audio of the text being read and related "Read Scripture" explanation videos from The Bible Project.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that hearing God's words (the Bible), in addition to reading it, is very beneficial. As well, having engaging educational video content in context accelerates your learning, helps truths and concepts stick and provides a much needed big picture understanding of your daily reading.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, we've made one reading plan available: The One YearÂ® Bible. The NLT (New Living Translation) version of the Bible is used to sync with the available audio/podcast.
              </p>
              <p>
                As new audio content and podcasts are discovered that read through a popular Bible reading plan, we will add them. Please let us know of Bible reading plans that include freely available audio, and we will consider incorporating them into this site.
              </p>
