                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thebibleproject.com/">The Bible Project</a> is committed to creating free, compelling, and engaging video content about the Bible. They have developed one or more introductory videos for each of the 66 books of the Bible. They have also developed video series that guide you as a learner of the Bible through, for example, word studies, biblical themes and gaining insight into how to read and understand the Bible. We've made their video series YouTube playlists available here for easy access.
